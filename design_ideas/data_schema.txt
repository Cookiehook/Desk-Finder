Node Objects:

Description - Name of location. E.g Reception, Eric's desk, central lift floor 3.
X Position - Actual 3D location of the node
Y Position - Actual 3D location of the node
Z Position - Actual 3D location of the node

Positions are used for weighting of the queue for A* search. May be difficult to implement accurately in real world.


Node Paths:

Parent Node - FK to node object
Child Node - FK to node object
Cost - How long it takes to traverse this relationship
Type - Stairs, indoor path, lift, external path. Allows for accessibility judgement calls.
Access Image - If Accessible is False, path to an image file showing why it's not accessible.
Active - Boolean. Whether the path is currently useable.

Access image allows users with limited motility make a judgement call on whether they can take that path. A crutch
user could takes a few small steps, but not 4 flights of stairs, whereas a wheelchair user could take none.
Active - Used to temporarily disable a relationship without losing it, in case of repair work.


Contact:
Name - Name of employee
Node (optional) - Where to find them

Plenty of room for improvement here on AD and Outlook calendar integration. May be implemented in future development,
but original focus is on building the route finder between two places.
